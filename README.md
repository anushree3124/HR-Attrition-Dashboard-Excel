➡️Here I developed an HR Data Insights dashboard for attrition analysis using Microsoft Excel.
➡️I have analyzed a dataset with 2925 employees and find what are the various factors affecting attrition.
➡️Implemented pivot tables and power pivot for effective data processing and visualization.

Insights from the Dashboard:-

➡️ Total employees: 2925, with 2433 (87%) currently active.
➡️ Average employee age: 37 years.
➡️ Attrition rate: 492 (17%) employees leaving.
➡️ Gender-based attrition: Female (37%), Male (63%).
➡️"Research & Development" department experiences the highest attrition.
➡️ Laboratory Technicians have the highest attrition rate among job roles.
➡️ 917 employees reported job dissatisfaction.
➡️ Noted a trend of male employees aged 26-35 leaving the organization.
These findings showcase my ability to analyze data and provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making in HR and talent management.
